## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Provide a one paragraph synposis of what your team accomplished this sprint. Don't repeat the "What's New" list of features. Instead, help the instructor understand how you went about the work described there, any barriers you overcame, and any significant learnings for your team.

During this sprint we accomplished the creation of the basic framework for our dining meal plan management project. To do this we first set about creating the database
using our ER Diagram as a reference. During the implenetation though, we did decide to change the database because the meal plan amount and balance system did not work well together and caused issues. The biggest barriers for this sprint were connecting the supabase database to the react project and getting all of the buttons to work with the correct tables, as some data would go into different tables and retrieve data from the wrong table. The biggest takeaway for our team this sprint was how hard it is to get things set up and working propelry. Everyone has different machines and it can be difficult to get code working on all of them especially for how big our project is and all of the dependencies. 

## Unfinished Work

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Implementation, besides for a few instances everything was quick to set up and edit.
  * Testing went really well, we didnt run into many issues with how stuff was implemnneted and everything matched our user stories and functional requirements.
  * Communication between everyone in the group was great. We were all able to discuss and coordinate the implentation and testing of our project. 
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Planning. It was difficult to find times to meet up because of everyones schedule being so full.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Payment System
   * Feedback System
   * Analytics System
   * Improvement of system styling
